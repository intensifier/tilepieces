    alt="Pipeline of innovation [Lightbulb design credit: Freepik]" width="200"></a>W3C released today its <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/2019/04/w3c-highlights/">W3C Strategic Highlights – Spring 2019</a>, a comprehensive survey
    of the essential work W3C conducts to achieve a Web for All, and select recent work in many areas where the Web can
    solve arising problems for real people.</p>
    <p>To the pipeline of innovations
      to
      enable
      the Web to scale to meet the new challenges and opportunities,
      we are making recent additions:</p>
    <ul class="show_items">
      <li> W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/04/pressrelease-wps.html.en">chartered a Web Payment Security Interest
        Group</a> to foster greater coordination and ultimately enhance the security and interoperability of Web
        payments.
      </li>
      <li> Web &amp; Networks: what is needed for the Web to take advantage of 5G, QUIC, and Edge Computing changing the
        topology of network-based services? We have started to flesh out a group charter in the wake of the W3C Web5G
        workshop in May 2018.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="some-test"><span style="color:yellow;background:black">some test Element</span>As the Web evolves
      continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called “evergreen
      recommendations” or “living standards” aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a
      feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.</p>
    <p>Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community. We see the
      maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web.</p>
